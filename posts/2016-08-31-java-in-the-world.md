# What's this post?

It seems Medium is not programmer-friendly. They don't support markdown... wait, there is an [API](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs)! So I created a [gem](https://github.com/rejasupotaro/mediumite) to upload markdown files from my terminal. To manage posts, I created a repo wrote [Rakefile](https://github.com/rejasupotaro/blog/blob/master/Rakefile).
Now I can write posts in markdown!

This post was uploaded through the system to see how it works. I realized this is not perfect. How to upload images is still a problem (I uploaded above images manually from browser).

I'm wondering if how programmers write a post on Medium.
